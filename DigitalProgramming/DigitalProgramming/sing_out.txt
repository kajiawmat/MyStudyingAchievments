Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see

Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see

If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives

This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives

From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors

The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see

Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now

All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see

Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads

they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed

dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see

Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

Watch a thread of cloud form above us, through the sky, so blue and wondrous
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
dead silence, trying to drown out all the noise

I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
they’re the reason for the hot red blood flowing through me!

Some come together, it’s time to get hurt, and feel all the tears that you can shed
The dream that we made, the pattern has changed, now it is blooming as it spreads
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
We want the same thing - the answers to the world!

What a view, from right here, in this position I know you had imagined
And from right there, I did the things that till now I have imagined
Even more, pushing way beyond the limits I had imagined
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of

Who in the world can find impulse -
From the pure start we all came from?
The force of life, it spreads so wide in primary colors
Who in this world could find an impulse -
From pure brightness in our souls?
Spreading these - the primary three that make our lives


This era is scrapped - of paper all blank, watched it building up then turn to black
But then as it fades, it accumulates, so tell me where the next one’s coming back
If tomorrow there’s a color somewhere waiting for us
We will paint it with primary colors! The ones that we can see


Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
In my mind, the things that I know - do they shine and glimmer in yellow?
Blue again, these days we we discover, memories of one another
- Silently they’re growing within us, up until they’re born with a yellow voice

Both hues, blending into something new
The green on the flowers blooming in the field as they grow, taking water from the sky -
That’s all that I dream of.

We start at zero, so breath and let go, and feel the red inside you as it flows
The lines that we make, the shells that we break, flowers are blooming as they grow
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
All the rules that are unknown right now
