Why, of all the many colors - blue is what we see up above us?
That’s all that I dream of.
Thoughts of yellow screaming in my head, intertwined by one single thread of
I’m trying to make sense of the miserable days that I’ve led, 
The formulas bend, I’m holding my pen, I’m gonna learn the secrets of this life, 
Standing here, right in the spot I thought I dreamed of
